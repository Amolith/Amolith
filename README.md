I care a great deal about free software, so I avoid using GitHub wherever
possible. Most of my work is on [SourceHut], a full-featured, open source, and
permissively-licensed software forge supported by its users. Some of my older
work is on [Forgejo], a git host I run as part of [NixNet].

If you are in a position to do so, I encourage you to migrate your repositories
to a more trustworthy platform. For more information about Forgejo, see
[forgejo.org], and for SourceHut, head to [sourcehut.org]. The latter is
especially nice as its entire collaboration model is based around email, making
it _much_ more distributed than platforms like GitHub and even Forgejo (though
Forgejo is working on federation through ActivityPub).
