Hi :)

GitHub is proprietary software owned by a horrid company. Unfortunately, it's
also where much of the open source world has chosen to host its software.[^1]
Thus, my GitHub account is _primarily_ for collaboration; I'm not really
hosting any of my own projects here.[^2] Instead, _everything_ I work on and
create has a copy on [git.secluded.site](https://git.secluded.site).

I'm a member of the [MBOA.dev](https://mboa.dev/) worker-owned co-op that
creates/maintains:

- [JMP.chat](https://jmp.chat) — your phone number on every device exclusively
  using free software
- [Cheogram.com](https://cheogram.com) — set of extensible services aiming to
  connect open communication networks: telephone, email, SIP, Jabber, and
  others
- [Soprani.ca](https://soprani.ca) — umbrella project for the software powering
  JMP and Cheogram
- [Adresilo.com](https://adresilo.com) — search Google Maps without giving
	Google _any_ personal data (aside from the query)
- [Togethr.party](https://togethr.party) — your very own Mastodon-compatible
  fediverse instance

I also co-host a couple podcasts:

- [Linux Dev Time](https://linuxdevtime.com) — Professional software developers
  Amolith, [Kevin](https://kbknapp.dev/), and
	[Andy](https://www.artificialworlds.net/) join [Joe](https://joeress.com/)
  and guests to discuss developing with, and for Linux.
- [Linux Lads](https://linuxlads.com) — three Irishmen plus that one American
  (Amolith) casually chat about Linux, free software, hardware, and
  occasionally interview some neat people.

[^1]: please consider [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org) instead
[^2]: except [Willow](https://github.com/Amolith/willow), to maybe get more
      contributors once I start working on it in earnest again
