I care a great deal about free software and being productive, so I avoid using
GitHub wherever possible.[^1] Most of my personal work can be found on
[SourceHut], a full-featured, open source, and permissively-licensed software
forge supported by its users. Some of my older work can be found on [Forgejo],
a git host I run as part of [NixNet].

If you are in a position to do so, I encourage you to migrate your repositories
to a more ethical platform as well. For more information about Forgejo, see
[forgejo.org], and for SourceHut, head to [sourcehut.org]. The latter is
especially nice as its entire collaboration model is based around email and I
find the workflow /vastly/ superior to GitHub's fork/modify/commit/push/open PR
model.

    GitHub is not free software and using GitHub to host projects is not
    productive. GitHub's extreme gamification of software development is a detriment
    to the software development ecosystem. I'll eventually write about this on my
    blog, but in the meantime, _[We need to talk about your GitHub
    addiction](https://ploum.net/2023-02-22-leaving-github.html)_.
