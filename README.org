I care a /great/ deal about free software from an ethical and moral
standpoint. Because of that, I avoid using GitHub wherever possible and
delete forked repositories after contributions have been merged
upstream. Much of my personal work can be found on [[https://git.nixnet.services/Amolith/][Gitea]], a git host I
run as part of [[https://nixnet.services][NixNet]]. I also have repositories and contributions on
[[https://sr.ht/~amolith/][SourceHut]], a fully libre software forge supported by its users.

If you are in a position to do so, I encourage you to migrate your
repositories to a more ethical platform as well. For more information
about Gitea, see [[https://gitea.io][gitea.io]], and for SourceHut, head to [[https://sourcehut.org][sourcehut.org]]. The
latter is especially nice; its entire collaboration model is based
around email and I find the workflow /vastly/ superior to GitHub's
fork/modify/commit/push/open PR model.
