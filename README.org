I care a /great/ deal about free software from an ethical and moral
standpoint. Because of that, I avoid using GitHub wherever possible and
delete my repositories after contributions have been merged. Much of my
personal work can be found on [[https://git.nixnet.services/Amolith/][Gitea]], a git host I run as part of [[https://nixnet.services][NixNet]].
I also have repositories and contributions on [[https://sr.ht/~amolith/][SourceHut]], a fully libre
software forge supported by its users.

If you are in a position to do so, I encourage you to migrate your
repositories to a more ethical platform as well.
